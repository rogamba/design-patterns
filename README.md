# Design Patterns

Series of design patterns examples in Java, taken from the book "Head First Design Patters" by Eric Freeman & Elisabeth Robson (highly recommended).

This is a series of super simple examples to examplify each one of them.

To run the exercises, go to each directory independently and compile with:
```shell
javac -d classes *.java
```
This will generat a class/ subdirectory in the pattern directory.

To run the execute:
```shell
java -classpath ":classes/" Driver
```
This executes the Driver clas which normally contains the **main()** method.
